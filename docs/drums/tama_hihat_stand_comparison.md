Tama Hi-Hat Stand Comparison
===============
Surprisingly, this comparison matrix is not found on the Tama site. A link to their
 product page is [here](https://www.tama.com/usa/products/hardware/hi-hat_stands/). 
There are currently 12 Tama hi-hat stands in their product line.

* Dyna-Sync Hi-Hat Stand HHDS1
* Speed Cobra 910 Lever Glide Hi-Hat Stand HH915D
* Speed Cobra 310 Hi-Hat Stand HH315D
* Iron Cobra 900 Lever Glide Hi-Hat Stand HH905D
* Iron Cobra 900 Velo Glide Hi-Hat Stand HH805D
* Iron Cobra Remote Hi-Hat Stand HH905RH
* Iron Cobra 600 Hi-Hat Stand HH605
* Iron Cobra 200 Hi-Hat Stand HH205S
* Iron Cobra 200 Hi-Hat Stand HH205
* Classic H-Hat Stand HH55F
* Stage Master Hi-Hat Stand HH45WN
* Stage Master Hi-Hat Stand HH45SN

The following matrix condenses the list by leaving off the single-braced HH45SN and 
HH205S, the remote HH906RH, and the Classic HH55F.  There were some normalizations 
made to the features. For instance, the Speed Cobra
is listed here a longer pedal although the Iron Cobra's pedal is listed as 
"Long" on the Tama site.

## Analysis

The biggest differentiator amongst the stands is the Action, with Direct Drive 
and Kevlar Level Glide being the most expensive.  The next price point is in the
smoothness of the action in terms of the hinge.  The different adjustments 
possible play a role in the pricing as well.  For example, "Tilt System" titls
the hi-hat toward the drummer).
